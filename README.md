**Hi! I'm Alok. 👋**

I love solving real-world problems through code.
As a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student, I’m passionate about building meaningful software that bridges ideas and impact.

**What I’m up to:**
- Building tools that solve everyday problems.
- Exploring open source – learning from the community and contributing where I can.
- Leveling up my problem-solving skills with new technologies.
